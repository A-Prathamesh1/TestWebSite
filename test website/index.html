      <textarea rows="8" cols="100">C:\Users\prath>mvn --version
        Apache Maven 3.6.0 (97c98ec64a1fdfee7767ce5ffb20918da4f719f3; 2018-10-24T11:41:47-07:00)

      <p><h3>Using Maven</h3>: Dependacy management tool, since various commercial companies organization,
       enterprise software venture developes platform independent applications, to access libraries jars and packages(knowledge) stored functions acts as accumulator,
       remote server maintains latest code repository of artifacts that can be downloaded as per the platform. 

        Maven build cycle, how to make a test run on jenkins when test fails on jenkin becase there is an element that can not be loaded.
        Maven downloads the latest jars and other files I need selenium testNG logging and cucumber Junit to set up environment of testing web services, UI automation environment.
        So my manager data analyst developer we all decide to stay organised with framework to efficiently use of fetures of language such as reusability, extendibility. 

        Since we all belong to an commercial enterprise coming up with some a Time service which tells everything about you. 
        Group name is "spacetimecomplexity" short can be space time to identify project uniquely, everything is art so hard work will result in artifact we call that artifact as my-app.

        So group is used to identify the project uniquely, com.timespace.app artifact ID- my-app, version 0.1(major.feature.patch).
        since we are using maven project it provides Junit unit testing framework by default.

        So if some one with source code of whatever function in whatever domain for whatever may be the problem, can be tested for accurecy unitwise or one function at time.
        is unit testing good for code coverage? Code coverage: Number of lines whos pourpose and output is being tested. its a dumb metric to evaluate tests quality, since just by maximizing the number of code lines being tested doesn't convey anything besides everyline in code is executing.
        Even if we check the code function by function, there will be situatons in commercial projects that dosent convey the expected results. So reasons may be different.(TDD vs BDD).

        Some developers approch Test Driven Development, they first write a failing test for function and once test fails they revisit function and inspect what needs to be modified for correct ouput.
        Following this decipline dosent give much thought to how service is behaving and the rest can be read at BDD cucumber.  
        Where emphasis is given on the behaviour verification of the developement.   

        Command to generate maven repository with some details is: Its better to isolate this in separate folder as my app. 
        
        Once changed in to that folder, using CLI get this done. It downloads the latest junit repo, alogwith necessary files.
        
        <textarea rows="3" cols="100">mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=0.1 -DinteractiveMode=false</textarea>
        
        This command has generated project structure for my-app artifact of com.mycompany.app group(/domain more on this soon). version 0.1.
        now cd my app will give you first glimpse of your project object model POM.xml containing configuraion of project.
        On command prompt you see the projects structure by tree command. 
        So the mvn acrhetype:generate creats the hierarchy of folders and files. 
        you can also see the jar files we have in Java Runtime Environment 1.8 and the maven provides junit frame work for unit testing.
        our archetype my-app is configured in pom.xml

        Here xml file contains the meta data encoded in to xensible markup language. Its used to share data about data that is configurations. Which is exchaged over the network, so when we configure our test to be run on jenkins we provide jenkins with the pom.xml of our project,
        which it uses to build the entire project.

          <h3>Git: Source version control: </h3>
            <p>Every Single member of your team wont be working in physically close places, teams often work in co-ordination developing and maintaining web-services.
              Every code pushing or pulling developer will be authenticated with the machine he/she is using. 
              Same function can be developed or worked out by multiple developers. 
              Development testing deployment major branches, Every team keeps co-ordination with every other member.

            </p>

      
      <p>
          <h3>Jenkins</h3>: All that code that is pushed by various members of distributed teams, needs to be combined in
          deciplined way so that every single repository required to build the project is available at the runtime.
          Jenkins scripts can be triggered using poll SCM option, following are the various ways in which a jenkins biuld can be configured.

            1) Run the builds whenever there is code pushed in to specific branch.
            2) We can also run local builds in jenkins using batch script in jenkins shell/bash.
            3) Scripts can be triggered per hour per day, every friday at 11pm.
          
      </p>
      <p>
          <h3>TestLink</h3>: Test Link is test management tool, where tasks can be assigned using tsetlinks interface.
            Since testlink keeps tracks of bugs, it keeps bug reports patches, and makes life easier for amigos. 
      </p>
      <p>
          <h3>Jira</h3>: Jira is also a bug tracking tool by Atlassian, it can be installed while using jenkins.
            Bug can be submitted for review, tracked, managed , it's a good tool to pipeline applicaion development alonside jenkins.

    <p>21st December 2018, Test Automation consists of verifying and validating the performance of web-services and API's as per the SRS Sytem requrement specification.
3 amigos deicide the story needs to be developed in scrum meeting mostly attended by stakehoders such as data analyst, developer, tester also product owner who is interested 
developing the soulution of his problem and willing to support financially. 
Test cases can be developed usign another language such as python with selenium framework,

    <p>
      23rd Dec 2018, performance: Apart from primary service provided by the feature, response time, resource usage, reliability
      Workload: Number of users served determined scalability of service, 
      stability: performance under varying loads. Perf testing. WRITE(iperf command).

      web service must run on all modern browser versions and as many old browsers as possible versions.

      Zero Day: new Attack that surfaces, never seen/detected/known before. Bug whos patch is yet to be developed.
      Security posture of client is what we analyse after the testing.
      Internal Pentesting and Extenal PenTesting. Wireless/Physical.

    Stages of penetration testing: 
    <b>Pre-engagement</b> : Talk to your client about goal of PT,
    Should the vulnerabilities be expoited. or just verified, Social engineering or Not ? 
    Since PT has time limit its better to focus on findig quality Vulnerabilities. priotizing them for exploitation.
    NASL Nessus Attack Scripting language.
    <b>DEfacto</b> standards for vunerability sccaning. 
    Scope: How many IP addresses, reporting format etc. 
    On What days of week pen test should be performed. 
    Gettting soeones contact to report the things. 
    Communication is the key. 
    Most IMP "get out of jail free" card : Written permission that even s single port scan can take network down. 

    <b>Information gathering</b>: OSNIT Open Source Intelligence Gathering.

    Publically available info to connect to system.

    <b>Threat Modelling</b>: Findings are valuable from attacing point of view : Most sensative/ business critical impactful findings are used to break in.

    <b>Vulnurability analysis</b>: disvoering vulnerability to exploit. Readymade scanners are available, however with experiece what to explore to expoite becomes clearer.
    <p>Post Exlploitation</p>: connect-scan-repeat. New information obtained during the first exploitation is used to find more gathring and keep repeating until. 
    <b>Reporting</b> : Summary and report, Customizsed, screenshts, HTML, CSV, .nessus XML e-mailed after every scan. Sensible to both technical and laymans.

    While adding the virtual host to your, LAN or BSS, it must be added a bridged adapter, we are bridging the internet connection from our Localhost to vitual host.
    It's important to keep my own laptop safe from the malicious host (myVM) it has to take its own responisibility to represent itself as a separate node. 
    Confirmed by checking subnet mask of locahost and VM.
    Without this there are 2 other options such as NAT and Host only, NAT can be used to translate all the malicious requests from my laptop localhost. So Don't be stupid, saftey (anonymity) first.

    While testing internet connection for VM, ifconfig couldent return the IP of VM having same Subnetmask as localhost.
    when ipconfig dosent work we need to append  ";%systemroot%\system32" to path. 
    restart a new cmd window, and test connection, do the same in VM, if bridged adapter is selected and
