    <h2>Selenium Automation with Java using TestNG, Maven, Git, Jenkins, TestLink, Jira</h2>
    <p>21st December 2018, Test Automation consists of verifying and validating the performance of web-services and API's as per the SRS Sytem requrement specification.
3 amigos deicide the story needs to be developed in scrum meeting mostly attended by stakehoders such as data analyst, developer, tester also product owner who is interested 
developing the soulution of his problem and willing to support financially. 
Test cases can be developed usign another language such as python with selenium framework,
    </p>
    <p>
      23rd Dec 2018, performance: Apart from primary service provided by the feature, response time, resource usage, reliability
      Workload: Number of users served determined scalability of service, 
      stability: performance under varying loads. Perf testing. WRITE(iperf command).

      web service must run on all modern browser versions and as many old browsers as possible versions.
      Selenium 1.0 + WebDriver = Selenium 2.0
      Sauce labs mobile equivalent of selenium.

      Zero Day: new Attack that surfaces, never seen/detected/known before. Bug whos patch is yet to be developed.
      Security posture of client is what we analyse after the testing.
      Internal Pentesting and Extenal PenTesting. Wireless/Physical.

    Stages of penetration testing: 
    <b>Pre-engagement</b> : Talk to your client about goal of PT,
    Should the vulnerabilities be expoited. or just verified, Social engineering or Not ? 

    Scope: How many IP addresses, reporting format etc. 
    On What days of week pen test should be performed. 
    Gettting soeones contact to report the things. 
    Communication is the key. 
    Most IMP "get out of jail free" card : Written permission that even s single port scan can take network down. 

    <b>Information gathering</b>: OSNIT Open Source Intelligence Gathering.

    Publically available info to connect to system.

    <b>Threat Modelling</b>: Findings are valuable from attacing point of view : Most sensative/ business critical impactful findings are used to break in.

    <b>Vulnurability analysis</b>: disvoering vulnerability to exploit. Readymade scanners are available, however with experiece what to explore to expoite becomes clearer.
    <p>Post Exlploitation</p>: connect-scan-repeat. New information obtained during the first exploitation is used to find more gathring and keep repeating until. 
    <b>Reporting</b> : Summary and report, Customizsed, screenshts, HTML. Sensible to both technical and laymans.

    Pyament is the thing How much how many per IP ? Money Money Money.

    <h1>Trying to learn pt on stabler/outdated linux platform and windows XP SP-2, also Ubuntu 7</h1>
    <p>Installing VMware: Kali 1.0.6 VM i486.7z precompressed 7.Zip 32 bit .vmx</p> 
    While adding the virtual host to your, LAN or BSS, it must be added a bridged adapter, we are bridging the internet connection from our Localhost to vitual host.
    It's important to keep my own laptop safe from the malicious host (myVM) it has to take its own responisibility to represent itself as a separate node. 
    Without this there are 2 other options such as NAT and Host only, NAT can be used to translate all the malicious requests from my laptop localhost. So Don't be stupid, saftey (anonymity) first.

    While testing internet connection for VM, ifconfig couldent return the IP of VM having same Subnetmask as localhost.
    when ipconfig dosent work we need to append  ";%systemroot%\system32" to path. 
    restart a new cmd window, and test connection, do the same in VM, if bridged adapter is selected and
