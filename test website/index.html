    <h2>Selenium Automation with Java using TestNG, Maven, Git, Jenkins, TestLink, Jira</h2>
    <p>21st December 2018, Test Automation consists of verifying and validating the performance of web-services and API's as per the SRS Sytem requrement specification.
3 amigos deicide the story needs to be developed in scrum meeting mostly attended by stakehoders such as data analyst, developer, tester also product owner who is interested 
developing the soulution of his problem and willing to support financially. 
Test cases can be developed usign another language such as python with selenium framework,

      23rd Dec 2018, performance: Apart from primary service provided by the feature, response time, resource usage, reliability
      Workload: Number of users served determined scalability of service, 
      stability: performance under varying loads. Perf testing. WRITE(iperf command).

      web service must run on all modern browser versions and as many old browsers as possible versions.
      Selenium 1.0 + WebDriver = Selenium 2.0
      Sauce labs mobile equivalent of selenium.

      Zero Day: new Attack that surfaces, never seen/detected/known before. Bug whos patch is yet to be developed.
      Security posture of client is what we analyse after the testing.
      Internal Pentesting and Extenal PenTesting. Wireless/Physical.

    Stages of penetration testing: 
    <b>Pre-engagement</b> : Talk to your client about goal of PT,
    Should the vulnerabilities be expoited. or just verified, Social engineering or Not ? 

    Scope: How many IP addresses, reporting format etc. 
    On What days of week pen test should be performed. 
    Gettting soeones contact to report the things. 
    Communication is the key. 
    Most IMP "get out of jail free" card : Written permission that even s single port scan can take network down. 

    <b>Information gathering</b>: OSNIT Open Source Intelligence Gathering.

    Publically available info to connect to system.

    <b>Threat Modelling</b>: Findings are valuable from attacing point of view : Most sensative/ business critical impactful findings are used to break in.

    <b>Vulnurability analysis</b>: disvoering vulnerability to exploit. Readymade scanners are available, however with experiece what to explore to expoite becomes clearer.
    <p>Post Exlploitation</p>: connect-scan-repeat. New information obtained during the first exploitation is used to find more gathring and keep repeating until. 
    <b>Reporting</b> : Summary and report, Customizsed, screenshts, HTML. Sensible to both technical and laymans.
